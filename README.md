# HybridSwarm_VRP


## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid algorithm that combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). The hybrid approach aims to leverage the strengths of both algorithms to enhance the optimization process for VRP.

## Introduction

Vehicle routing problem can be described as  a fleet of vehicles having to visit some set of customers with some demands located in various cities. It involves finding the most efficient way to deliver goods or services. The primary objective is to minimise transportation costs and, in some cases, minimise the number of vehicles used while satisfying various constraints. 

## Features

Hybrid Algorithm Integration:

Combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) to leverage the strengths of both algorithms.

Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Solving:

Addresses the VRP, a classic optimization problem involving the efficient routing of vehicles to serve a set of customers.
